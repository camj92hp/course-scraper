        "The goal of this project is to develop a version 1 web scraper using Beautiful Soup to collect comprehensive information about the different degrees and courses offered at McGill University. The scraper is designed with three key steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. `soup_maker`: This function allows for the rapid creation of Beautiful Soup objects, facilitating efficient data extraction from web pages.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. `url_page_collector`: This step involves gathering all the relevant URLs from a single page, streamlining the process of scraping multiple pages simultaneously.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. `extract_course`: Create a function to extract detailed course information, such as credits, course descriptions, professors, and other relevant data.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. `extract_all`: By utilizing a Beautiful Soup object, this step effectively extracts the required course details and stores them in a well-organized dictionary.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, the project aims to build a functional web scraper that can systematically gather pertinent data about McGill University's degrees and courses, serving as the foundation for future iterations and enhancements."
